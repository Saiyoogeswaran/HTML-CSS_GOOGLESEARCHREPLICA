## How It Works ??

1. The present task entails the inclusion of three distinct files, namely two HTML files, i.e., Google_Homepage.html and License.html, and one CSS file, i.e., styles.css.
2. The Google_Homepage.html file encapsulates all the requisite contents that are needed for the Google search tab, whereas the License.html file is instrumental in facilitating knowledge acquisition concerning the anchor tags.
3. Additionally, styles.css embodies all the necessary styling details, along with the incorporation of various techniques to centre the content and button tags. 
4. By amalgamating these three files together, a replica version of the Google search has been created.
